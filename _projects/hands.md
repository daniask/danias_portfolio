  *'In the creative arts, the hand speaks, and one senses the tremendous power of the hand to convey human emotions. The hands are the organs of the body which, except for the face, have been used most often in the various art forms to express human feeling. The hands point or lead or command; the hands cry out in agony or they lie quietly sleeping; the hands have moods, character, and, in a wider sense, their own particular beauty. From prehistoric times to our own day, in every society known to science, the hands symbolize cultural behaviors, values, and beliefs.' (Ethel J. Alpenfels, Professor of Anthropology, New York University, New York City)*

My drawings depict the ways in which our hands speak for us. How they communicate with each other, with ourselves, how our hands can create beautiful art, heal, express love and pain, give and receive in all its forms. Hands are used for practical purposes, but also in design, in war, in charity, in birth, and at our final moments.

I have explored how to express hands in different mediums of art. I have drawn hands with graphite, with colour pencil, painted in water colours, acrylics and oil. I have used my own hands as reference and of family and friends, and learned through looking at classical painters, and created my own fantastical versions of hands. There is no limit to one's imagination!

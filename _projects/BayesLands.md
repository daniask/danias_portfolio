Stills of Decay
=====


## Overview

'Stills of Decay' is a series of work produced at Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture for my Bachelors of Fine Art's final thesis. 
My drawings show the eventual decay, rot or preservation of things, living and non living, discarded and neglected after use, after their purpose has left them or have, just simply expired.
Every ‘thing’ had its story and in a snapshot of a drawing is frozen in time. I hoped to capture the inevitability of decay and death and its toll on the things around us. It’s toll on a flower; that started in a vase and ended in a bin next to a Dun-hill.

Comparison of PT-Bayeslands with SC-Bayeslands for the Cr problem for 50,000 iterations. The panels show  estimates of the posterior distribution and trace-plot of the precipitation ($\rho$) for the SC-Bayeslands and PT-Bayeslands respectively. \textcolor{blue}{The trace-plots show the accepted or current values of the chain for the  given samples}. Note that the results for SC-Bayeslands are taken from earlier single chain experiments (with 5 \% burnin) while PT-Bayeslands features 25 \%burn-in.

Stills of Decay
=====


## Overview

'Stills of Decay' is a series of work produced at Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture for my Bachelors of Fine Art's final thesis. 
My drawings show the eventual decay, rot or preservation of things, living and non living, discarded and neglected after use, after their purpose has left them or have, just simply expired.
Every ‘thing’ had its story and in a snapshot of a drawing is frozen in time. I hoped to capture the inevitability of decay and death and its toll on the things around us. It’s toll on a flower; that started in a vase and ended in a bin next to a Dun-hill.

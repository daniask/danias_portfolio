Dania 

I, Dania Shahkhan am a visual artist, art educator, researcher and the co-founder of Poiesis.Socialart, a digital archival space featuring socially engaged art and podcasts on art and culture. My past art work ranged between detailed pencil drawings symbolising the decay of objects discarded in the environment such as in ‘The Urbane’ (2018) and paintings symbolising mental health which was exhibited in shows called ‘The Human Condition’ and ’Invisible Beasts’. My medium ranges between portraits and landscape in greyscale drawings, vivid acrylic paintings and a mix of poetry and new media. I have exhibited in three shows in Karachi, Pakistan: at Artkaam Gallery, at T2F (The Second Floor) and Arts council where it was covered widely by the press. 
I have conducted a workshop on Theatre of the Oppressed (T2F, Karachi) in Pakistan and I am currently writing and researching on theatre and socially engaged art practices. I received my B.F.A. in painting and new media from Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture (Karachi, Pakistan) and M.Ed. from ArtEZ University (Arnhem, Netherlands) in 2019.
